As a web developer with over four years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and hone my skills in web development. Currently, I work at bizzNEST, a for-profit digital agency that is a branch of DigitalNEST. At bizzNEST, I focus on website development, client management, communication with design management, troubleshooting WordPress issues, configuring DNS, and project management using Scrum tools like Asana for a group of interns.

In addition to my work as a web developer, I am also a freelance photographer. I have been offering photography and services since 2019, and I use various Adobe software such as Photoshop for resizing, formatting, retouching, and graphics. I currently work for a wedding agency where formatting images in Lightroom is a standard operation. Additionally, I enjoy using Adobe Express for creating graphics and marketing materials.

Aside from my work as a web developer and freelance photographer, I am also working on a side app project that is based around family photography. This is a type of service I have years of experience in, and I am excited to explore this area further.

Overall, my experience as a web developer and freelance photographer has allowed me to explore my passions and gain valuable insights into the world of web development and digital media. I am excited to continue learning and growing in these fields and look forward to what the future holds. :)
